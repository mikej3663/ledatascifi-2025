    "Anything on a line after a `#` symbol won't be executed as code. Doing so is how you leave comments in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use comments to add additional information and context that the functions and variables don't make obvious.\n",
    "2. Start your coding life over-commenting. This serves the purpose of helping you remember the basics as a form of note taking.\n",
    "3. As you get more comfortable, you'll _**reduce**_ your use of comments! \n",
    "    1. Good code can tell much of the story without comments. \n",
    "    1. **The problem with comments is that if you change the code, you don't have to change the comments and the code will still run.**\n",

    "## Example 2: Excessive comments\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Elasticity = Percent Change in Quantity / Percent Change in Price\n",
    "# Elasticity = 0.4 / 0.2 = 2\n",
    "# See Shapiro (2005), The Economics of Potato Chips,\n",
    "# Harvard University Mimeo, Table 2A.\n",
    "compute_welfare_loss(elasticity=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you later change this file and you change `elasticity=2`. It will be tempting to forget to change the comment associated with it, or explain why. \n",
    "\n",
    "So using comments makes it possible that your code becomes internally inconsistent; almost by definition, programmers have an interesting tendency towards a (typically smart) form of laziness!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Self-documenting code\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the exact same code in a way that prevents that possible problem. Look at this version, which still documents the code just as well because it is **self-documenting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# See Shapiro (2005), The Economics of Potato Chips,\n",
    "# Harvard University Mimeo, Table 2A.\n",
    "percent_change_in_quantity = -0.4\n",
    "percent_change_in_price = 0.2\n",
    "elasticity = percent_change_in_quantity/percent_change_in_price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to write self-documenting code\n",
    "\n",
    "Making code easy to read and maintain is a guiding principle for experienced coders because we've all wasted so much time fixing code or simply trying to use code we wrote a few years ago. Self-documenting code makes this easy and saves a lot of headaches. That is why the aim for self-documentation underlies the logic behind the [Good Data](10_Golden_4) page, the [Directory](10_Golden_6) page, how we name files and functions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more tips to help write more readable code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the naming of variables and the structure of the code to help guide a reader through your operations\n",
    "- `x` and `y` are usually (but not always!) bad variable names because they are uninformative\n",
    "- Calling a dataframe `df` should be avoided as well\n",
    "- Documentation is sometimes necessary and unavoidable. (Citing \"The Economics of Potato Chips\" in the example above is smart.)\n",
    "- Documentation can clarify that, _\"Yes, I did mean to do this on purpose!\"_\n",
