These snazzy handouts are from [Sara Miller](https://github.com/sm-miller/RDD), and cover ways to estimate **casual** regression coefficients.

1. [Randomized Control Trials](RCT.pdf), e.g. classical medical trials.
2. [Regression discontinuity design](RDD.pdf) is a way to look at how outcomes are different for units (e.g. people, firms) just above or below some cutoff
3. [Difference in difference](DiffNDiff.pdf) compares how the difference between two groups of units ("treated" and "untreated") changes after one group becomes treated. (Thus the name "diff in diff".) A common usage of this is to look at two states, where one of the states passes a law.

RDDs and DiDs can often be done on the dataset like those we examine in class, with the addition of some external data about the cutoff (in RDD) or about the passage
