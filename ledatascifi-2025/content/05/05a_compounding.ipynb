    "## Optional: Log returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as an FYI, there is another way to compound returns you might hear about in other contexts: using \"log returns\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"log return\" is $ln(1+r)$ or $ln(R)$, using the natural log. It's the _continuously compounded_ rate of return. If you earned a simple return of $r=10\\%$, one month, the continuously compounded rate of return over that month is $ln(1+0.1)=9.5\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, no one speaks in terms of continuously compounding returns, but log returns has its uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "1. You can **not** add the simple rates of returns across time to get the total compounded return: $r_{[0,1]} +r_{[1,2]} \\neq r_{[0,2]}$\n",
    "2. But you **can** add log returns across time to get the correctly compounded total log return: $ln(1+r_{[0,1]}) +ln(1+r_{[1,2]}) = ln(1+ r_{[0,2]})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustration: If returns in January ($r_{[0,1]}$) are 10%, and also 10% in February ($r_{[1,2]}$), your total return for both months ($r_{[0,2]}$) is $(1+r_{[0,1]})(1+r_{[0,2]})=21\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally,  $ln(1.1) +ln(1.1) = ln(1.21)=0.1906$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This second observation makes it easy to compound returns in large datasets another way than what I showed above. Taking advantage of the fact that $e(ln(x))=x$ (in step 2 below) and $e^a*e^b*e^c=e^{a+b+c}$ (in step 3 below), we can rewrite $R[0,T]$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R[0,T] = \\prod_{t=1}^T R_t = \\prod_{t=1}^T ( e(ln( R_t)) ) =e(\\sum_{t=1}^T ln(R_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to compound returns, you can sum the log returns. Then to convert the compounded log return back to a simple return, just exponentiate and subtract 1.\n",
