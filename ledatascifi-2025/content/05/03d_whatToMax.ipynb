    "- In medical tests more broadly, false negatives are really bad - if someone has cancer, don't tell them they are cancer free. Thus, medical tests tend to minimize false negatives.\n",
    "- Minimizing false negatives is the same as maximizing the true positives, aka the \"sensitivity\" of a test, since $FNR=1-TPR$. Better covid tests have higher specificity, because if someone has covid, we want to know that so we can require a quarantine.\n",
    "- In the legal field, false positives (imprisoning an innocent person) are considered worse than false negatives.\n",
    "- Identifying terrorists? You might want to maximize the detection rate (\"recall\"). Of course, simply saying \"everyone is a terrorist\" is guaranteed to generate a recall rate of 100%! But this rule would have a precision of about 0%! So you also should think about \"precision\" too. Maybe F1 is the metric for you. \n"
