    "1. [You will be added to the secret discussion board for class alumni.](https://github.com/orgs/LeDataSciFi/teams/alumni)\n",
    "    - The idea is that employers ask faculty in the department where the best finance students are that know python, and that's you. \n",
    "    - The alumni board makes it easy for me to share these opportunities. \n",
    "    - You're welcome to post in the group to let each other know about opportunities at your current organizations when you need to find good people.\n",
    "1. [Update your GitHub email to use a non-Lehigh address.](https://github.com/settings/emails) (Lehigh deletes your email after graduation.)\n",
    "1. I added some bonus content after this page:\n",
    "    - [Some cool projects you can try next.](06b_nextsteps) Working on interest-driven projects is the best model for skill growth and often results in work that gets attention.\n",
    "    - [If you haven't, check out the great finance packages to explore, use, and learn from last chapter.](05c_finpacks)\n",

    "I hope you've enjoyed the class and learned a bunch! This class is only an introduction to what can be done; clearly, there are galaxies of material on data science broadly and its possible applications to solve important (finance-related) problems. But you have the starting toolkit to explore that galaxy of possibility now.\n",

    "**My sincere hope is that this class has opened up some doors for you**, whether you end up developing code to solve a problem for your company or end up managing a group of devs that are doing the coding. \n",
