    "> - understanding the how \"data analysis/ML/<<buzz word #51>>\" fit into the bigger picture of producing and using our domain knowledge from finance. to quote Prof Gunther: data < info < knowledge < wisdom\n",

    "- regression (how-to, why-to, and what it \"means\")\n",
    "- logit, and some quick passes at other algorithms\n",
