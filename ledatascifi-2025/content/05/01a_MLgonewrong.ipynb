    "- ML/AI methods replicate patterns in the data by design \n",
    "    - [If you give it data with human biases, then the AI can easily become biased.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07187.pdf) This has led to debates about how to use ML (example - [ML algos fail to set cash bail without bias](https://www.wired.com/story/algorithms-supposed-fix-bail-system-they-havent/))\n",
    "    - Amazon's engineers used ML to evaluate applicants but taught the model [that males were automatically better](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/10/amazon-hiring-ai-gender-bias-recruiting-engine)\n",
    "    - Criminal sentencing [based on \"risk predictions\"](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) overweight race\n",
    "    - [Online advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6822) - Google is more likely to serve up arrest records in searches for names assigned \"primarily to black babies\"\n",
    "    - [Medical treatments vary by race](https://www.wired.com/story/how-algorithm-favored-whites-over-blacks-health-care/)\n",
    "- Humans are strategic and will exploit incentives created by algos and exploit the algo itself\n",
    "    - Facebook's targeted ad categories initially allowed hate groups to form \n",
    "    - Microsoft's chat bot was hijacked by 4chan users to teach the bot hate speech\n",
    "    - Uber must consider how changes to its dispatch algorithm will alter driver behavior\n",
    "- ML/AI tools are not always the right tool \n",
    "    - Zillow's pricing model was best-in-class but [still lost nearly 400m in a single quarter!](https://donbowen.github.io/slides/slides/L01_intro_github.slides.html) \n",
    "- [Data leakage is common](03f_leakage3) and can lead to false \"discoveries\" of impossible performance gains\n",
    "- Some problems are simply hard\n",
    "    - Predicting stock returns is hard! The best predictive R2 for individual stocks [in this paper](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/5/2223/5758276) (open access [here](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/download/ML.pdf)) is just 1.80% per month.\n",
    "    - IBM's Watson tried to predict cancer. How'd it go? According to internal documents: \"This product is a piece of shâ€“.\"\n",
    "    - [Google Flu Trends](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf) consistently over-predicted flu prevalence\n",
