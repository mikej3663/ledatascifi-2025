    " \n",
    "1. You can focus on the p-values rather than the t-stats. However, knowing the threshold values of the t-stat (those above) is useful, as many people distribute research by discussing t-stats instead.\n",
    "2. If a p-value for the coefficient in a regression is below 0.05, \n",
    "    - We say that the relationship between that variable and Y is **\"statistically significant\"** at the 5% level.\n",
    "    - Now, **consider the direction**: Is the coefficient positive or negative? Does this align with your intuition and economic theory?\n",
    "    - Now, [**consider the \"size\" of the coefficient**](02d_interpretingCoefs.html#comparing-the-size-of-two-coefficients): Is a \"reasonable\" change in X leading to a \"small\" or \"big\" change in Y? If the relationship is small, it may not be important enough to care about even if true.\n",
    "    - Now, take a step back: **Statistically significant** does NOT mean X causes Y. You need additional information to make these claims. That's what the next page is about.\n",
    "3. Practically, if the p-value is above 0.05, most researchers consider completely disregard the coefficient (and ignore the sign and the value). Because you can't say the coefficient is statistically distinguishable from zero, they basically interpret the coefficient for that variable as being zero. Meaning: Ignore the sign, ignore the value, assume the coefficient is zero. \n",
