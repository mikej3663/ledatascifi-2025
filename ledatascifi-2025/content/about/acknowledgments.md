## Gratitude

This class is a work in progress. But I've been touched by the contributions and help I've gotten from so many people, including:
- The inaugural TA Daniel Appierto fixed many, many mistakes and contributed ideas that shaped parts of the site. 
- The 2021 TA, Jason Dinh, continued that tradition and created some video content as well!
- The 2022 TA, Julio Veracruz made more video content, contributed to the website, and designed the class session on website creation. 
- The inaugural class of students in 2020 took the class in two delivery modes, and thus dealt with 5x the growing pains a new class would usually have. Their patience with me was fantastic, and their feedback materially improved the course. Some even created pages for this site! 

In addition to sites listed in the [resources](resources), this course draws on great work from many, many people. Special credit is due to:
- The [STAT545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) course at UBC initially developed by Jenny Bryan and its [companion site](https://happygitwithr.com/) detailing how to set up a Git/Github workflow with R was the key inspiration.
- The [Python Data Science Notebook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) 
- Grant McDermott's [EC607](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) course at Oregon
