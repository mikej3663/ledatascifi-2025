You could start trying [to analyze it here](http://drivendata.co/blog/worldbank-poverty-benchmark/). This has a good example of the process you might follow. After you're done, you can see [the winner's code and discussion of the winning approach](https://github.com/drivendataorg/pover-t-tests/tree/9a1918856c5e6ee537caed103eb80dabefb2fe44)

  - [Wine, but not necessarily the best data source](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
- [UC Irvine has a data repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), some of these are available via scikit package
