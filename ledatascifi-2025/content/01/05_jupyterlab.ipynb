    "1. When you are typing inside a cell, you are in **Edit mode**\n",
    "    - I.e. you're typing markdown or python code\n",
    "    - You can tell you are in edit mode because there is a dark border around the cell and its contents are sharp\n",

    "    - **Switch into edit mode by hitting `Enter` or double-clicking in the cell.**\n",
    "2. **Command mode** means that keystrokes are interpreted by Jupyter as \"commands\" on the notebook itself \n",
    "    - Example of a command: inserting a new cell, or executing the code in a cell\n",
    "    - You can tell you are in command mode because the cell and its contents are fuzzy\n",
    "    - Also, the bottom of the panel says \"Mode: Command\"    \n",
    "    -  **Switch into command mode by hitting `ESC`**\n",

    "> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found yourself searching before. ~~Being an effective practitioner of data science~~ Being efficient in many aspects of life these days is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n",
