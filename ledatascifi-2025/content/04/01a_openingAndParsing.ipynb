    "\n",
    "```{note} Have you ever noticed how, when you google something, the URL of the resulting search has the information about the search?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose I Google \"gme stock price\" (without the quotes). The resulting URL might be: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=gme+stock+price\n",
    "\n",
    "This URL has several parts: \n",
    "1. The stem, ending in a question mark: \"https://www.google.com/search?\"\n",
    "2. Everything after the stem is the parameters of the search\n",
    "3. A search can contain many parameters, and they will be separated by \"&\"\n",
    "4. Each parameter is structured like: \\<parameter name\\>=\\<parameter value\\>\n",
    "5. Parameter 1: My browser client is a version of firefox\n",
    "6. Parameter 2: My query (\"q\") is gme+stock+price (plus signs because spaces aren't allowed in URLs)\n",

    "[Let's go through the Neal Caren \"First API\" example. Some notes as we start:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nealcaren/ScrapingData/blob/master/Notebooks/5_APIs.ipynb)\n",
    "- **JSON is just a data storage structure, and in python it's a dictionary.** \n",
    "- In this example, we make the search give us JSON because it can be easier to extract data from JSON than HTML sometimes.\n",
    "- HINTS: \n",
    "    - Dictionaries: You look for what's in a dictionary with `dict.keys()` and then `dict['key']` will show you the value/object belonging to the key\n",

The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).\n",

See the caveat about `urllib2` above, but otherwise this code works. Greg uses `urllib` to open and `beautifulsoup` to parse, but if you want to, you should be able to rewrite his code using `requests_html` pretty easily. When you succeed, please email me! "
