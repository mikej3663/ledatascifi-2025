# # Estimating CAPM
# 
# - This file can estimate CAPM for any firms that Yahoo has ticker data for.
# - As written, it will estimate beta separately _for each calendar year_ in the date range you give it. But you can adjust it
# 
# - _Caveat: Yahoo Finance is more of a "quick and dirty" way to get return data. WRDS has more accurate return data._

# ## Load asset return data 
# 
# Load your stock returns. This file uses yahoo finance.
# The returns don't even have to be firms! They can be any asset. (Portfolios, mutual funds, crypto, …)

# choose your firms and years 
stocks = ['SBUX','AAPL','MSFT']
start  = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end    = datetime(2016, 12, 31)

# download stock prices 
# here, from yahoo: not my fav source, but quick. 
# we need to do some data manipulation to get the data ready 
import yfinance as yf
stock_prices         = yf.download(stocks, start , end)
stock_prices.index   = stock_prices.index.tz_localize(None)      # change yf date format to match pdr
stock_prices         = stock_prices.filter(like='Adj Close')     # reduce to just columns with this in the name
stock_prices.columns = stock_prices.columns.get_level_values(1)  # tickers as col names, works no matter order of tics
stock_prices # uncomment to print and see

# this is wide data... so if we want to create a new variable, 
# then we have to do it once for each firm...
# what if we have 1000 firms? seems tough to do...
# make long/tidy:
stock_prices = stock_prices.stack().swaplevel().sort_index().reset_index()
stock_prices.columns = ['Firm','Date','Adj Close']
stock_prices # print - now that is formatted nicely, like CRSP! 

# add return var = pct_change() function compares to prior row
# EXCEPT: don't compare for first row of one firm with last row of prior firm!
# MAKE SURE YOU CREATE THE VARIABLES WITHIN EACH FIRM - use groupby
stock_prices['ret'] = stock_prices.groupby('Firm')['Adj Close'].pct_change()
stock_prices['ret'] = stock_prices['ret'] *100 # convert to p.p. to match FF's convention on scaling (daily % rets)
stock_prices

# this shows that my "groupby" approach works, because 
# count of ret = count of adj close MINUS # of firms 
# meaning that the first day for each firm has no return data

# ## Get the factor returns 
# 
# Above, we got the asset returns, $r_i$. 
# 
# To estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in $r_i-r_f = \alpha + \beta (r_m-r_f)$, we need $(r_m-r_f)$ and $r_f$. Let's download those now.
# 
# Note: $(r_m-r_f)$ is the excess return on the market, which is _one_ "factor". Modern asset pricing typically uses 5 factors in tests.

# We need (r_mkt - rf), and rf
# the Fama French data library is a benchmark asset pricing dataset 
ff = pdr.get_data_famafrench('F-F_Research_Data_5_Factors_2x3_daily',start=start,end=end)[0] # the [0] is because the imported obect is a dictionary, and key=0 is the dataframe
ff = ff.reset_index().rename(columns={"Mkt-RF":"mkt_excess"})

assets_and_factors = pd.merge(
    left=stock_prices,

# ## Estimate CAPM
# 
# So the data’s basically ready. _(We need to do two quick things below.)_
# 
# Again, the goal is to estimate, **for each** firm, **for each** year, alpha and beta, from the CAPM formula.
# 
# Well, as we've said, if you are doing a "for each" on a dataframe, that means you want to use groupby!
# 
# So, I have a dataframe, and **for each** firm, and **for each** year, I want to \<do stuff> (run regressions).
# 
# That almost directly translates to the code we need: `assets_and_factors.groupby([firm,year]).runregression()`. Except there is no "runregression" function that applies to pandas groupby objects. But we can write such a function and then `apply()` it. Meaning, our plan is to basically use this code: `assets_and_factors.groupby([firm,year]).apply(<our own reg fcn>)`.
# 
# We just need to write a reg function that works on groupby objects.
